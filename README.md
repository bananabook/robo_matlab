# Robot in matlab with gui
This is a small script, that lets you control a three axis robot inside a matlab gui application. It can be useful to understand how extended coordinates can be used to manipulate frames. It also serves as a nice example on how to program graphic interfaces in matlab with live updating sliders.

# To see what it can do
start robot_gui.m in Matlab

roboplot.m is the script, that contains the mathematical necessities to manipulate the frames, it can be easily integrated in other contexts.
